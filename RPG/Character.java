// 2) Create a class called Character. 
// It should have the following member data:
// String name
// int experience
// int level
// int health
// int strength
// int intelligence
// int dexterity

// Create a default constructor for Character which initializes experience to 0, 
//level to 1, and strength, intelligence, dexterity to random numbers between 
//the ranges 8-20. health should then be set to strength + 10.

// 3) Create a function called gainXp. This function should take an int as an argument. 
//When the function is called, it adds the int argument to experience, 
//and if experience > level * 100 then increment level by 1 and reset experience.

//4) Create a method called attack. 
//It should do random + dexterity damage, where random is a random number between 0-10. 
//Simply print the damage that would be done.
//You get the idea. Build an RPG, or at least what you think the outline would be using OOP. 
//Then build a menu that let's you create characters. 
//Then build a different menu that let's you "fight" either other characters or Monsters 
//(could be a chance to create a Monster class).

//The main key to this is random number generation
